3. Graceful degradation is a design principle that ensures a web app still works even if some advanced features are not supported or fail. Users can still interact with limited but important functions. Service workers act as a proxy between the web app and the network. They can serve cached content when the network is unavailable or slow. It is convenient if the app can still be used when conditions are not optimal.
